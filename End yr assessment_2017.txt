Reviewer commenrts:Good work in RWS, follow the guidelines for rest half of the year.1) Ensure to apply best practices for quality code2) Apply the Adequate unit testing and share the code review checklists3) Communicate regularly for any observations internally4) Apply Parallel-programming where ever applicable in your project

End yr :1.Followed all coding standards defined at project level and delivered the product in mean time2.Implemented all the standards in project development like Style-cop,js-hint,css-cop etc to standardize the code and optimization was taken care.3.Delivered the code on time with good customer satisfaction.4.Have been invlolving in testing and development in parrellel on daily basis.5.Maintained good rappo with onsite co-coordinator's to get updated with client requirements.5.Got appreciation for the work done with onsite team.6.participated in several activities conducted by the organisation like Plantation,Tournaments etcCompetency & Career Development Plan:mid yr :Participate in the release process of projectReviewer comments:Attend Communication skills training, and learn new technologies in my learn.Follow the guidelines1) Take initiative in conducting some knowledge sharing session on the newly learned technologies2) Preparing and contributing the documents/code files to KM portal.3) Nominate for new technical trainings and communication trainings in "mylearning" portal
end yr:1.Have been attending the several e-learning courses to get updated and brushing up the latest technologies.2.Planning to work in different technologies and gain knowledge in different work flow process.3.Need to get more trained for improving the comunication skills

Career aspirations:To give my best in my professional work for overall benefit and growth of the company by my level of hard work. I will show my caliber and gain some experience and also will improve my self day by day.Overall performanceMid yr:
1.Successfully completed project deliverables as per given time lines.2.Maintained accuracy and completeness when worked on code development. Bugs/Issues were self-caught at an early stage.3.Tracking the defect sheet so there were rarely repeated issue has found. Reuse the codes so time line require to complete the work is less.4.Following the process when code is moving from dev to UAT to Prodction.5.Always discussed my leave plan well in advance with my team and client manager and got approval on the same such that work doesn't get affected.6.Made sure I have filled time sheet well in advance and got it approved on time form client manager so that work doesn't get affected and apply planned leaves in advance.
Reviewer comments :Overall performance is found good, but communication skills has to be improved. Lot of technical and functional training's has to be undergone and apply the guidelines for rest half of the year.1) As Technology is important to the project  - Adopt to learn and master new applicable technologies identified for the project2) Be a quick learner - of the project requirements and technology3) Adopt the Best practices for quality code4) Communicate regularly for any ongoing issues internally5) Conduct Technology understand/sharing sessions for project peers6) Work on improving the communication skills
End yr.1.As a Quick learner,gained knowledge and started working on new technologies like foundation CSS,Kendo UI,Asp.Net Core 1.0,Bootstrap,Angular JS and MVC6.2.Have been training for improving the comunication skills at my best.3.Have been improving the code skills to achieve the best standards.4.Received the client appriciation from the client for the testing project.
